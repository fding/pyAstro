pyAstro
=======

Python package with functions for astronomy, and specifically, orbit determination.

The n-body simulation for pyAstro will be the same as that for https://github.com/fding/nbody. 

When complete, this should allow analysis of .fit file images, basic astrometry, least-square plate reduction,
and orbit determination.

The code was first developed in the Summer Science Program (SSP) 2011.
